=== ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS SUMMARY ===
Period Analyzed: March 2024

FINDING: Overall moderation accuracy dropped significantly in March 2024.

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
- Primary driver: 'Hate Speech' category accuracy collapsed to 57-61% in March
- Afternoon shift showed worst performance at 57.9%
- Morning and Night shifts equally affected (60.3% and 61.4%)
- All other categories (Animal Cruelty, Bullying, Child Safety, 
  Self Harm, Violence) remained healthy between 85-90% across all shifts

KEY INSIGHT:
- The drop is NOT shift-specific — all three shifts show similar 
  underperformance on Hate Speech
- This rules out staffing or scheduling as the root cause
- The uniform failure across shifts points to a category-level 
  policy or guideline gap

HYPOTHESIS:
- Hate Speech moderation policies may have been updated in March 
  without adequate reviewer training
- Borderline Hate Speech content may lack clear decision guidelines,
  causing inconsistent outcomes across all reviewers

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
1. Immediate: Audit Hate Speech policy guidelines for ambiguity
2. Short term: Mandatory Hate Speech policy refresher for ALL shifts
3. Short term: Add Hate Speech accuracy as a standalone KPI 
   with a minimum 80% target in weekly scorecards
4. Long term: Create an escalation queue for borderline Hate Speech 
   cases to reduce inconsistent reviewer decisions
